/* Open CPV Solar Tracker Control V0.1 
 *  June 13th 2021
 *  tested with Arduino 1.8.7
Accomplished
- Floating average for sensor step tracking, improves precision and supresses oscillations. No effect on full speed moves.

Next steps:
- make sensor run error azimuth dependent on elevation. Azimuth changes have little effect close to Zenith.
